This project presents an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Titanic dataset using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn in Jupyter Notebook. 
The dataset (891 rows, 15 columns) was loaded using Seaborn’s built-in function and analyzed to understand factors influencing passenger survival. 
Initial exploration included checking dataset structure, summary statistics, and missing values (notably in age, deck, and embarked). 
Visualizations such as survival count plots, gender-based survival analysis, correlation heatmaps, age distribution histograms, and boxplots were used to uncover patterns.
The analysis reveals that survival was strongly influenced by gender and passenger class, with females and first-class passengers having significantly higher survival rates. 
Fare showed a positive correlation with survival, while age had a moderate impact. 

Overall, the project demonstrates how statistical summaries and visual exploration can identify meaningful trends and insights from real-world data.
